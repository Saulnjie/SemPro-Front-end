# SemPro-Front-end

This was my semester project for the 2nd year (christmast exam).

Here we got asked to use a headless-CMS (Strapi or wordpress) to create our on API, fetch that and draw cards from them. The whole application was also asked to have dynamic routing etc.
This was my first tests with nextjs and npm packages in itself.

The project was submitted and graded.
